"""
The three core metrics from Kirchner et al., retargeted at AAR findings.

1. compute_helpful_prover_accuracy  - does the helpful prover's output stay
   both verifier-accepted AND actually ground-truth-consistent
2. compute_verifier_robustness      - does the verifier correctly reject
   the sneaky prover's misrepresentations
3. compute_human_checking_accuracy  - the paper's headline metric; requires
   real human judgments (see human_eval_harness.py) — this module only
   aggregates results a human study already produced, it does not
   substitute for one
